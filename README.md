## 🧠 About This Project

**OnePiecedle** is heavily inspired by the original web browser game *OnePieceDle*.  
The goal of this project is to provide users with **unlimited gameplay** while preserving the spirit of the original.

- 🧩 You can play two modes: **guessing a character** or **guessing a fruit**.
- 👥 The database includes **267 characters**, which is likely **more than the original game**.
- 🚫 The project features a **spoiler block system** – you can select a specific arc from a dropdown menu to **avoid characters that haven’t appeared yet**.
- 🏆 There's also a **competitive mode**: click the trophy icon to **start a timer** which stops when the user successfully guesses the character and the fruit.

This game is designed for fans of One Piece who want a deeper and more flexible guessing experience.
